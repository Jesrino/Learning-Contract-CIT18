            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>
              One of my expectations is that I hope to enhance my knowledge of the fundamentals concerning this subject like how to enhance my knowledge in PHP and other languages. I  also hope to build skills that you can use in real-life scenarios for my own benefits.Next is I also anticipate being given constructive comments that would cater to the improvement of my coding skills and knowledge.
Then I hope to develop my understanding so that I can become more assertive when it comes to speaking on the topics of this course.
Finally I will also be able to finish this course with a lot of knowledge that will enable me to proceed with further learning effectively.

        <section id="motivations">
            <h2>Motivations</h2>
            <p> One of my motivations is to attain knowledge that will assist me when I get a job. Since I have a great curiosity in developing and advancing my knowledge hence I wish to drill down more in the topic.
                Next is I also need to compete with myself as well as work on learning new effective habits of learning. Then I aim to achieve high grades and academic recognition. And finally I want to become a more well-rounded and informed individual when it comes to coding and other tech.</p>

        <section id="contributions">
            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>One of my contributions is that actively participate in class discussions and group activities to ensure that I will not be a burden to others. I would also complete and submit my assignments and activities on time.
 I will support my classmates by sharing resources and collaborating effectively. 
I will ask questions when I need clarification and encourage others to do the same.</p>

        <section id="hindrances">
            <h2>Hindrances</h2>
            <p>One of my hindrances was my time management since I also have other responsibilities. Perhaps, there may be some problems in some certain topics I may have a hard time grasp.
                 I might also get distracted by Facebook or any other related activity and not concentrate much on my schoolwork.I may feel discouraged if I score lower than I expected.It can cause me to lose some self-confidence when it comes to contributing to new topics in class.</p>
